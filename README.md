## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 25Apples â€“ an embedded systems enthusiast currently learning and building with **low-level firmware**.

### ðŸš€ Projects I'm exploring:
- STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi and IoT basics (coming soon)

### ðŸ›  Skills I'm working on:
- STM32CubeIDE + HAL
- Git & GitHub project organization
- C programming (embedded focus)
- Writing clean and modular code

### ðŸ“‚ Check out my repositories:
I keep each project in its own folder for clarity â€“ with examples for each peripheral.

ðŸ“« Reach out if youâ€™re learning embedded too â€“ we can grow together.  
Thanks for visiting my GitHub!
